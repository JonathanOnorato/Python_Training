    "Pandas is a data manipulation system within Python. In a lot of ways, it's easy to think of it as being similar to Microsoft Excel, as it has a somewhat similar structure. Instead of sheets, data is stored within something called a Dataframe. Dataframes have rows and columns, just like you would for an Excel sheet. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, we'll build a dataframe from the ground up, within Python, to give you a better feel for how this works. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll need to first import Pandas. Pandas is a commonly used tool, and most of the time the Python community refers to it as \"pd\" instead of \"pandas\" within their code lines. As such, when we import it we will import it with an *alias* of \"pd\", which means that when we want to call pandas, we just have to type \"pd\". This isn't a critical step, but it's something that will feel very natural with time. "
